# Movie-Recommender-System
In this Project, I'm trying to familiarize myself with the Recommender System techniques such as:
1. Content Based
2. Collaborative Filtering 
    - Memory Based Collaborative Filtering 
    - Model Based Collaborative Filtering

In addition to Python, I'll try to implement solutions using Hive and Pig using Apache Ambari in the pre-configured 
Hortonworks Data Platform


I also set an Amazon EC2 instance and used Spark2
